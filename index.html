      <h2>Hello: Call me William.</h2>
      <p class = "init-desc">I'm a graduating Materials Engineer a general computer programming
        hobbyist. In fact, I love messing with anything that can be programmable.

      <h2>My Skills:</h2>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="gear" src="pics/gear.png" alt="engsession-descript">
        <p>As of right now (2022), I'm graduating in Materials
          Engineering. It is a really nice area, and of all of its
          specializations, I really have a knack for Metals and Metallurgy.</p>

      <div class="skill-row">

        <p>Lately I also took a liking for coding. It is nonetheless wonderful
        to see all these lines and all the hardwork pay off as I see things I
      built with it (like this Website!). I code in Python, the  WebDev pack
    (JavaScript, CSS and HTML), and I do some stuff with Arduino as well!</p>

    <div class="skill-row">

      <p>As for Arduino. Lately I'been messing and experimenting with it. My
        endgame with this platform is to develop habilities in automation,
        assemble a fully functional robotic arm and have lots of fun in the
        meanwhile.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="skill-row">
      <img class="people" src="pics/people.png" alt="people-pic"/>
      <p>Engineering is day after day merging with areas like management and
        human resources, so I'm developing my interpersonal relationship
        habilities and skills which allow me to deal with the public and my
        coworkers in an optimal way. </p>
